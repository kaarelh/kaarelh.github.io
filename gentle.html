id="a-gentle-primer-on-caring-including-in-strange-senses-with-applications">A
gentle primer on caring, including in strange senses, with
applications</h1>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Firstly, I will define a straightforward model of caring about other
people. I think it is a good model for understanding (<a
href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ex63DPisEjomutkCw/msg-len">and</a>
predicting) people’s actions. I also think it’s pretty meta-good to have
one’s own ethics effectively be of approximately this form. However, I
will not argue for either of these claims in this post.</p>
<p>I will make a few observations about the relationship between Pareto
improvements and social welfare in this model. I will then clarify the
model in a crucial way, leading to a low-complexity way to think about
caring across time. I will use this framework to make some observations
on value drift, to give a justification of (some) sin taxes, and to
state an insight into parenting.</p>
<p>I see this post as mostly not having ground-breaking insights, but
instead as thinking through basic things carefully. I think it’s
surprising how much one can get out of such a simple model. I will
mention a number of open directions for further thought along the way.
It was my intention to keep the main text relatively modular and
approachable<sup><a href="#fnw15azc0t52">[1]</a></sup>, with further
discussion in the footnotes.</p>
<h1 id="the-model">The model</h1>
<p>Let <code>$I$</code> be the set<sup><a
href="#fnotr8566uag">[2]</a></sup> of all moral patients.<sup><a
href="#fnzo0p8u1gma">[3]</a></sup> For a moral patient
<code>$i \in I$</code>, let <code>$x_i$</code> denote the <em>personal
utility</em> of <code>$i$</code>. One might also call this the welfare
of <code>$i$</code>, or how much fun it’s having, or the total amount of
joy its experiences spark, or (the integral of) valence or pleasantness,
or personal pleasure.<sup><a href="#fnnlu2c1o2hv">[4]</a><a
href="#fnpvgx1cm14ai">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea we would like to implement here is that <code>$i$</code> is
not necessarily (just) trying to maximize <code>$x_i$</code> – it’s
possible that <code>$i$</code> cares about (certain) other people, and
not just instrumentally because of e.g. some contract, but
terminally.<sup><a href="#fnbyxp6pcpj1r">[6]</a></sup> In particular, we
will assume that the <em>terminal utility</em> of <code>$i$</code>,
denoted<code>$u_i$</code>, takes the following linear form<sup><a
href="#fnp51figh5wmg">[7]</a></sup>:</p>
<p>\[u_i=\sum_{j\in I} w_{ij}x_j.\]</p>
<p><code>$u_i$</code> is what agent <code>$i$</code> strives to
maximize.<sup><a href="#fnjpm19ccbslr">[8]</a></sup> For simplicity, we
will assume WLOG that for every <code>$i$</code>, we have
<code>$w_{ii}=1$</code>.<sup><a href="#fn7i9j3ic2nn">[9]</a></sup> We
will also assume all <code>$w_{ij}\geq 0$</code>.<sup><a
href="#fn37tsnbto8zs">[10]</a></sup> If one likes, one can think of the
weights <code>$w_{ij}$</code> as living in a matrix with rows and
columns indexed by <code>$I$</code>. One can treat this as the adjacency
matrix of a weighted directed graph.<sup><a
href="#fnnjo7es0kttg">[11]</a></sup> The weights <code>$w_{ij}$</code>
capture how much <code>$i$</code> cares about each element of
<code>$I$</code>.<sup><a href="#fnct5ssnu6sxe">[12]</a></sup> For
example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>$i$</code> being completely altruistic corresponds to having
<code>$w_{ij}=1$</code> for all <code>$j\in J$</code>;</li>
<li><code>$i$</code> being<code>$$</code> completely selfish corresponds
to <code>$w_{ij}=0$</code> for all
<code>$j\\in I\\setminus\{i\}$</code>;</li>
<li>a mother who really cares about her immediate family and also cares
just enough about people in general to sacrifice herself to save
<code>$10^4$</code> random people might assign weight
<code>$\frac{1}{2}$</code> to her partner, weight
<code>$\frac{1}{2}$</code> to each of her children, and weight
<code>$10^{-4}$</code> to every person not in her family.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or one might assign weights according to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship">genetic
relatedness</a>, or according to distance in some friendship graph, or
according to physical distance, or according to mental similarity to
oneself.<sup><a href="#fncmtbungjxa">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-inequivalence-of-society-level-and-individual-charity">The
inequivalence of society-level and individual charity</h2>
<p>To give a first taste of this model in action, I will use it to
explain why supporting society-level charity is very far from implying
that one needs to engage in individual charity<sup><a
href="#fn3gd5642wytd">[14]</a><a href="#fnmzndkvntf0p">[15]</a></sup>,
contra what seems to sometimes be (implicitly) claimed<sup><a
href="#fnszgzmtakqvb">[16]</a></sup>. Assume an agent <code>$i$</code>
is living in a country of <code>$10^7$</code> rich people, and that
there are <code>$10^7$</code> poor people living outside the country.
Conveniently for the ease of our analysis, it happens that
<code>$i$</code> is a simple agent, assigning to each other agent
<code>$j$</code> a constant weight <code>$w=w_{ij}$</code>. Now
<code>$$``$i$</code> is considering the following three worlds:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>A world in which <code>$i$</code> personally donates $100 to a
poor person.</p></li>
<li><p>A world in which the rich country passes a development aid law
that takes $100 from each citizen and sends it to a poor
person.</p></li>
<li><p>A world in which no donations happen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s assume that all <code>$10^7$</code> poor people are equally
poor, that all <code>$10^7$</code> rich people are 100 times wealthier,
and that personal utility is the <code>$\log$</code> of wealth.<sup><a
href="#fn9jecte9s1ll">[17]</a></sup> Since the derivative of
<code>$\log y$</code> is <code>$\frac{1}{y}$</code>,<sup><a
href="#fnnzah3oi4zl">[18]</a></sup> in a linear approximation, the poor
person gains <code>$100$</code> times the personal utility that the rich
person loses from each such donation. The condition on <code>$w$</code>
that is equivalent to <code>$i$</code> being selfish enough to prefer
World C to World A is that <code>$w&lt; \frac{1}{100}$</code>. In words:
<code>$i$</code> needs to be sort of selfish. But the condition
corresponding to <code>$i$</code> preferring World C to World B is
roughly<sup><a href="#fnpmtumhoqcip">[19]</a></sup>
<code>$w&lt;10^{-9}$</code>. In words: <code>$i$</code> needs to be
really really selfish. We see that there is a vast range, namely
<code>$10^{-2}&lt;w\leq 10^{-9}$</code>, where <code>$i$</code> is
selfish enough to prefer not to make a personal donation, but where
<code>$i$</code> would nevertheless prefer a society-level donation
(which <code>$i$</code> participates in) over no donation. I would guess
that many a reasonable person inhabits this range.</p>
<p>(All this said, I admit that the implication from public to private
charity could be more compelling if one is more of a deontologist<sup><a
href="#fn2ajg1n97vag">[20]</a></sup>, and in particular thinks that
taxes are also justified solely as duties. And in practice, there are
also other things, such as the deadweight loss from taxes or government
inefficiency, to consider, which could move the needle toward private
charity.)</p>
<h2
id="pareto-improvements-and-total-welfare-subsection-for-nerds">Pareto
improvements and total welfare (subsection for nerds)</h2>
<p>The agents in our setting might sometimes come across an
option<code>$$</code><sup><a href="#fnts18kk360xk">[21]</a></sup> which
every agent would prefer over another option, but which is nevertheless
worse from the perspective of a social planner.</p>
<p>To say the same thing formally, in world <code>$A$</code>, let the
terminal utilities of agents be <code>$(u_{i,A})_{i\in I}$</code>, and
in world <code>$B$</code>, let these be
<code>$(u_{i,B})_{i\in I}$</code>. Suppose that for every agent
<code>$i\in I$</code>, we have <code>$u_{i,A}\leq u_{i,B}$</code>, i.e.,
every agent <code>$i\in I$</code> weakly (terminally) prefers world
<code>$B$</code> to world <code>$A$</code>. We will assume that a social
planner cares about <code>$u=\sum_{i\in I}x_i$</code>. It is then
nevertheless possible that the social planner prefers world
<code>$A$</code> to world <code>$B$</code>, i.e. that</p>
<p>\[u_A=\sum_{i\in I} x_{i,A}&gt;\sum_{i\in I} x_{i,B}=u_B.\]</p>
<p>For an example of this, suppose that two parents <code>$i,j$</code>
are considering buying an expensive toy for their child
<code>$k$</code>, splitting the cost evenly. The toy would contribute
<code>$+10$</code> to the utility of <code>$k$</code>, but bearing half
the cost would change the utility of each of <code>$i,j$</code> by
<code>$-9$</code>.<sup><a href="#fnwfuwmyzfq0e">[22]</a></sup> Suppose
that the parents do not care about each other, but both care about the
child with <code>$w_{ik}=w_{jk}=1$</code>, and that the child is
selfish. It is then the case that <code>$i,j,k$</code> each support
buying the toy, but a social planner would not, because
<code>$+10-9-9=-8$</code>. This strikes me as a situation that might
occasionally happen in practice.</p>
<p>However, various other nice properties are true in this model. I will
quickly state these in terms of some undefined (but suggestive)
terminology. I will leave making sense of and proving these as an
exercise to the interested reader (commenter?).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If no <code>$i$</code> cares about some <code>$j$</code> more than
about <code>$i$</code>-self, then any Pareto trade (between two agents)
with no externalities is good.<sup><a
href="#fnabry5qgidbq">[23]</a></sup></li>
<li>More generally, at least two people have to personally lose from any
contract that is [a Pareto improvement but bad].</li>
<li>A corollary: the example we gave earlier is the simplest one.<sup><a
href="#fna7iss8eekf">[24]</a></sup></li>
<li>If <code>$w_{ij}=w_{ji}$</code> for all <code>$i,j$</code> and every
agent has an equal amount of care to give to the other agents who are
asked to consent to a contract<sup><a
href="#fnn50o3xla7p">[25]</a></sup>, then if everyone consents to the
contract, it is good.<sup><a href="#fnglxqnn0k1nf">[26]</a><a
href="#fnv2806nsijz">[27]</a></sup></li>
<li>If at least one person affected by a Pareto improvement is perfectly
altruistic, then it is good.</li>
<li>Any Pareto improvement for selfish agents is also a Pareto
improvement for the same caring agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$$</code>An interesting further direction is to investigate the
impact of more care on total wellbeing. That is, suppose the agents
start off inhabiting a default world (perhaps specified by current
property rights and contracts). They come across various possible
contracts, and they agree to a contract iff it is a Pareto improvement
over the current default, after which the default switches to the world
specified in this contract. Should we expect worlds where agents care
more about other agents to end up better off in this process? Here are
some observations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the extreme case where every agent is completely altruistic,
everyone will indeed agree to precisely those contracts that are
socially good.</li>
<li>Conditional on all <code>$w_{ij}\leq w_{ii}$</code> throughout,
considering only trades involving two agents, increasing a weight
<code>$w_{ij}$</code> can only increase (in the sense of set inclusion)
the set of possible trades which are Pareto improvements.<sup><a
href="#fntqlbh3eg4u">[28]</a></sup> So since all such Pareto
improvements are good, if every contract available only involves two
agents, then increasing weights can only be good.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it follows from our earlier example and from the fact that
selfish agents only agree to socially good contracts that caring more
would turn some socially bad contracts into Pareto improvements. This
makes it difficult to unambiguously conclude that caring more is good
from the perspective of a social planner. I think we would need to
propose a distribution of possible contracts to proceed further with
this line of inquiry. My guess is that given a reasonable distribution,
more care will turn out to be better. I see figuring this out as an
interesting open research direction.</p>
<h3 id="instrumental-caring">Instrumental caring</h3>
<p>A lot of what looks like caring in practice is instrumental caring,
i.e. something like a set of agents signing a (possibly implicit)
contract that commits each one to consenting to future contracts as if
they cared about the other signatories. Alternatively, simply bundling
many contracts (for instance, bundling a contract with the contract of
one agent paying another agent) could look similar, although this might
be computationally more difficult in certain domains in practice (in
particular, we might need to think seriously about bargaining), and the
outcomes could look quite different if there is uncertainty about the
contracts one comes across in the future. I would expect gains from
instrumental caring to largely substitute for the gains from terminal
caring in domains where transaction costs are low (for instance, the
important stuff being easily measurable could be helpful), between
agents at similar power levels.</p>
<p><img
src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/33c42e9bb4e04cedce1ed8dde0ab6449cd90451070a5c7dc.png" /></p>
<p>To say a little more, what I mean here by two agents having similar
power levels is that it would be possible for each to turn its own
personal utility into the personal utility of the other at a rate close
to <code>$1:1$</code>.<sup><a href="#fnxy4wqltqb7c">[29]</a><a
href="#fnrgfs3tkf4sh">[30]</a></sup> The reason this is relevant is that
for a set of agents where every pair has similar power levels<sup><a
href="#fn8y8q7me2dc6">[31]</a></sup>, a contract which is socially good
is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks
improvement</a>, which can be converted into a Pareto improvement by
adding appropriate compensation requirements into the contract (and
accepting the new contract leads to a state which is as good as if the
initial contract was accepted (with the same total amount of utility
being distributed differently)).<sup><a
href="#fnhg0fkisay9h">[32]</a></sup> So, at least given that transaction
costs are low, we would expect socially good contracts to be amended and
accepted when the agents involved are similarly powerful.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, in domains where transaction costs are high or
where the agents have very different power levels, I would expect the
realized total utility to depend more on the degree to which different
agents care about each other. One instance where transactions are very
problematic (impossible?<sup><a href="#fnp1g3pd992oa">[33]</a></sup>) is
when the agents inhabit different times.</p>
<h2 id="slicing-people-up-across-time">Slicing people up across
time</h2>
<p>Instead of thinking of a person as a single agent inhabiting a long
time interval, let’s partition a person into a number of agents, one for
each short time interval. Namely, let’s choose a partition of time into
short intervals (e.g. of length <code>$1$</code> second); let the set of
starting times of these intervals be <code>$T$</code>. In the ~simplest
case, there is a set of people <code>$J$</code>, independent of our
decisions (i.e. the same in all possibilities we are considering), with
the set of weights being also being independent of our decisions. In
this case, the set of agents would be <code>$I=J\times T$</code>, so</p>
<p>\[u_i=\sum_{j\in I} w_{ij}x_j=\sum_{k\in J}\sum_{t\in
T}w_{i(k,t)}x_{(k,t)}.\]</p>
<p><img

<p>In more generality, we might want to allow the set of agents in
existence to be different for the different possible worlds under
consideration, both because our decisions might lead to different people
(in particular, a different number of people) being born, and also
because our decisions might affect what certain already living people
end up being like, on which we might want to have the weights depend
(which is possible in our formalism iff we treat these different
possible versions of a person as different agents). It might also be
desirable to allow the weights to depend on indexical information –
e.g. <code>$i$</code>-now might assign a high weight to the agent
<code>$i$</code>-at-time-t loves<sup><a
href="#fnke9pj87357">[34]</a></sup> – which we will handle by letting
indexical information be part of the agent specification. In other
words, if needed, we will for instance consider
same-agent-except-not-loved-by-future-me and
same-agent-except-loved-by-future-me to be different elements of
<code>$I$</code>.</p>

<h1 id="some-slightly-strange-externalities">Some slightly strange
externalities</h1>
<p>We will now examine some cases where an action has externalities on
other agents that the agent cares about. Externalities often cause some
socially suboptimal contracts to go through (or some socially optimal
contracts to fail to go through), especially in cases where transaction
costs are high, including instances where some contracts are hard to
enforce, or in cases where the agents involved have very different power
levels.<sup><a href="#fnh75h74o2lta">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>All the cases of externalities which we will be looking at will be
cases where a single agent can make a decision which affects multiple
agents. If this agent is perfectly altruistic w.r.t. the set of agents
that are affected, it will make a decision iff it deems it socially
optimal. Things become more interesting if the agent is completely or
partially selfish. For such agents, the state is often justified in
taxing or subsidizing actions which have significant externalities.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the question of externality pricing (i.e. figuring out
how large the tax (or subsidy<sup><a
href="#fno10wlnqlnn">[36]</a></sup>) on someone should be for doing
something which has externalities on other agents, starting from the
case where everyone is completely selfish. Suppose agent
<code>$i$</code> is deciding whether to perform an action which has
negative externalities on each agent in a set
<code>$J\subseteq I$</code> who are practically unable to trade with
<code>$i$</code>. Taxing <code>$i$</code> for performing this action at
the sum of what agents in <code>$J$</code> would maximally want to pay
to avoid the negative externalities on themselves ensures that
<code>$i$</code> takes this action iff <code>$i$</code> would take this
action if trading were possible (with zero transaction costs and perfect
information about the willingnesses to pay of each agent). This seems
like a reasonable proxy for the action being socially good.<sup><a
href="#fn1qxak3woezk">[37]</a></sup> Or at least, this level of
externality taxation is most likely better than none.</p>
<p>[\BEGIN{REMARK FROM FINAL EDIT} I initially thought that handling
externality pricing in terms of dollars is better than handling it in
terms of utilities. The version in terms of utilities would be to price
an externality so that the externality tax leads to a utility loss for
<code>$i$</code> which is the sum of utility losses for all the other
agents. Dealing with caring becomes straightforwardly just summing up
these losses with weights given by <code>$1-w_{ij}$</code> to find the
appropriate utility cost and picking the monetary cost to match that (if
it’s not clear what I mean by this, it will be after reading a little
bit ahead in the body of the post).</p>
<p>One reason for doing externality pricing in terms of dollars is that
this might be more tractable to figure out in practice. (The utility
approach is getting close to “let’s try to figure out what the optimal
thing for each person to do is, and pay them iff they do that”.) Another
reason is that if the externality tax collected is actually paid out to
the people suffering the externalities, then this is exactly the minimal
price at which a trade with compensation is guaranteed to have positive
utility. At this price, exactly those actions go through for which
externalities can be compensated so that the whole contract has positive
utility for everyone. Even so, it is possible that the people suffering
the externalities would prefer a different price, assuming there has to
be one price across versions of the same contract involving agents with
different personal preferences, for the same reason that a monopoly
would not price at the efficient market price. And e.g. in instances in
which these people are many orders of magnitude poorer, such a monopoly
price would likely lead to higher total utility than the efficient
market price, at least if we look at contracts of this type in
isolation.</p>
<p>The utility version of externality pricing leads to the optimal level
of production-without-a-wealth-transfer, which also seems like a
reasonable proxy to aim for.</p>
<p>I guess that a somewhat more accurate and more complicated way to
think of this is the following. There is an action <code>$X$</code> we
are considering taxing, which different agents get different personal
utility from, but which always has the same negative externalities.
Firstly, assume there is an optimal use of the additional tax dollars
collected from a tax (possibly, reducing other taxes), with marginal
rate <code>$r$</code> of turning tax dollars into utility, which we
assume the government knows and implements. <code>$r$</code> would be
good to know, and I guess that an adequate government would try to
constantly have a good estimate of <code>$r$</code>. Second, assume that
everyone who might do <code>$X$</code> has the same rate of turning
marginal dollars into utility, let this be <code>$s$</code>. I would
guess that it is also fine to instead let <code>$s$</code> be [the
average of this marginal exchange rate across all the people doing
<code>$X$</code>] – hopefully this is not too dependent on the tax rate
in the cases we will consider. Given the total of utility losses from
externalities per action – call it <code>$$``$t$</code> (and assume it
is a constant independent of the number of actions), and given
<code>$r$</code> and <code>$s$</code>, and given the empirical
distribution for utilities gained from <code>$X$</code>, for a proposed
externality price <code>$p$</code>, the effects of the tax are the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For each time action <code>$X$</code> is taken, there is a utility
difference of <code>$p(r-s)$</code> coming from the transfer from the
agent taking the action to the government money pool (and its subsequent
use).</li>
<li><code>$$</code>For each time action <code>$X$</code> is taken, there
is some utility gain to the agent taking the action and utility loss
<code>$t$</code> to the agents on whom the externalities fall.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we are really lucky and <code>$r=s$</code>, then all we have to
care about is maximizing utility from 2, which is equivalent to a trade
happening iff the utility gain to the agent is greater than the utility
loss from externalities. And this happens exactly if we ensure that
<code>$pr=t$</code>, so <code>$p=\frac{t}{r}$</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems likely that <code>$r&gt;s$</code>, since
otherwise the government could do at least as well as its optimal thing
to spend money on by just giving marginal money to (people like) the
agent, at least if we ignore the fact that some money would leak out of
the loop into administrative costs (although maybe it is often the case
that they should be doing this, with the optimal policy being lowering
other taxes on the agent, which also has the benefit of decreasing
administrative costs, hmm). I’m not sure if I have anything interesting
to additionally say about the general case here. I would like to
understand this better. Maybe one can assume that the distribution of
personal utility gains to agents taking <code>$X$</code> is something
simple, and then derive some interesting general result?</p>
<p>Everything considered, especially given some of the messiness you
will see discussed later, my guess is that the utility approach would
have been better, but I won’t fix this now. I might rewrite this entire
section if people seem interested.</p>
<p>\END{REMARK FROM FINAL EDIT}]</p>
<p>So far, we have covered the extreme cases where a decision-maker is
completely altruistic or completely selfish, which is unfortunately 0%
of all cases :). Motivated by these simple cases, I propose pricing
externalities by figuring out how much each agent in
<code>$j\in J$</code> is maximally willing to pay for the externality,
multiplying this by <code>$1-w_{ij}$</code>, and summing these over
<code>$J$</code>. It feels like there should be some decent
justification of this, but I am currently failing to see one. This
should definitely follow if one makes the simplification that utility is
just equal to money (times a constant), which will be reasonable in
certain regimes (in particular, this is similar to assuming that
everyone involved has the same power level).</p>
<p>Another half-assed justification for this pricing rule is that it is
the unique method which satisfies the following three properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The externality tax is a function of the form
<code>$\sum_{j\in J}f\_j(y\_j,w_{ij})$</code>, where <code>$y_j$</code>
is the maximal amount <code>$j$</code> would be willing to pay for the
externality on <code>$j$</code>-self. For instance, this is intuitively
motivated if we want to ask each agent for what they would pay for the
“externality unaccounted for by caring”, and summing the answers to find
the total price to assign to the externality.</li>
<li><code>$f(y\_j,0)=y\_j$</code> and <code>$f(y_j,1)=0$</code>. This is
a strong version of the statement that we are extrapolating between the
selfish and altruistic case. For instance, the second statement is
saying that if <code>$i$</code> is completely altruistic toward
<code>$j$</code>, then we should not assign any further price to the
externality on <code>$j$</code>. Intuitively, the externality should
already be internalized.</li>
<li>Maximal simplicity assumption: the externality tax should be a
linear function if we vary only <code>$w_{ij}$</code> (with any constant
values for all the other weights).</li>
</ol>
<p>To be precise: this is the unique solution even if we fix a single
contract and only allow weights to differ. If we instead aim to pick a
pricing method across different contracts (but with the same functions
<code>$f_j$</code> across contracts), then we should be able to replace
the second assumption with the weaker assumption that we are
extrapolating between the completely selfish and completely altruistic
case.</p>
<p>A poetic way to state our conclusion is that externalities should be
priced according to the total effect on people (and parts of people)
external to the agent’s web of caring.</p>
<h2 id="having-kids-and-abortion">Having kids (and abortion)</h2>
<p>In my observation, (social) libertarians who think bringing people
into existence is valuable (both positions which I like) often tie
themselves into knots over abortion. Here’s what seems to me to be the
obvious way to think about abortion. One’s child’s worthwhile life is a
positive externality (to the child)<sup><a
href="#fnjb9tszmcsp">[38]</a></sup>, and the obvious policy w.r.t. any
externality is to internalize it, i.e. in this case to have a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_benefit">subsidy</a> for
having children.</p>
<p>There’s a number of important details to be figured out regarding the
best payment scheme, e.g. a lump transfer upon birth, or monthly
installments, or a lump transfer when the child earns a PhD, or % of the
child’s salary,<sup><a href="#fnp0o5st9uvl">[39]</a></sup> which track a
child living a worthwhile life to various extents and could get <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodharted</a> to
various extents, but I do not want to discuss this further here.
Instead, I would like to assume that a parent has the option to press a
button that creates a child and secures the child a life of known
personal utility (possibly also with some effect to the parent’s
personal utility, of size depending on the circumstances), and that
there is no way for the parent and child to sign a contract that the
child has to compensate the parent for this personal utility gain in the
future. It seems clear that the amount the parent cares about their
child matters a lot in getting the externality pricing right here, and I
hope we have made some theoretical progress towards answering this
question.</p>
<p>A further messy issue is choosing the right way to compare money from
different times. One option for this is to discount by average
government bond interest rates. Another option is to turn money into
utility on each side of the equation first, either at the rate for the
given person or at society’s median rate at their time. I will not
discuss this further now, but thinking this through and coming up with
an estimate for the optimal subsidy size seems potentially practically
important.</p>
<h2 id="time-discounting">Time discounting</h2>
<p>By time discounting one’s personal utility, I mean assigning future
versions of oneself lower weights in our model.<sup><a
href="#fngbt1ztx1obq">[40]</a></sup> I claim that most people time
discount utility.<sup><a href="#fnc7xvfkjcu2">[41]</a></sup>This is just
another way of saying that people are not fully altruistic towards
future versions of themselves. Many activities, e.g. smoking, drinking
alcohol, exercise, saving, studying, have obvious externalities on
future versions of oneself. Many <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_tax">sin taxes</a> can be argued
for as being usual externality taxes, with externalities being on
partially-uncared-for future selves.</p>

<h3
id="democracy-is-less-myopic-than-its-constituent-individuals">Democracy
is less myopic than its constituent individuals</h3>
<p>I claim that democracy optimizes for utility with significantly less
time discounting than individual people. But why would the “sum” of a
bunch of short-sighted opinions be any less short-sighted? I recommend
pausing here for a bit to see if you can figure why that would be the
case.<sup><a href="#fncqmry6vuyz">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here is my explanation. My first subclaim is that most people would
sacrifice themselves for at most like <code>$10^5$</code> other people.
It follows from this that in a democracy with at least like
<code>$10^6$</code> people, considerations about other people’s utility
should dominate the voting decision of each person.<sup><a
href="#fnmxnlt22bn3">[43]</a></sup> (This is assuming that democracy is
just people voting on contracts, and that the costs or benefits of each
contract are fairly evenly distributed across people. The conclusion
will not apply e.g. if the law that people are voting on says that you
and only you should stop smoking.)</p>
<p>My second subclaim is that most people have a discount rate for other
people which is significantly lower than their discount rate for
themselves. One reason this might make sense is that to person
<code>$p$</code>, the difference between <code>$p$</code>-now and
<code>$p$</code>-20-years-from-now feels a lot bigger than the
difference between random-guy-now-<code>$p$</code>-has-no-relation-to
and random-guy-20-years-from-now-<code>$p$</code>-has-no-relation-to.
This could be because the random walk <code>$p$</code> will be on for
the next <code>$20$</code> years will take him reasonably far from who
he is now (average societal drift plus aging plus driftless random
walk), but the expected difference between the two random guys from
different times is determined by societal drift only. If for instance
one’s weights are based on mental similarity or on distance in some
relatedness graph, then I think one can conclude from this observation
that the sum of weights one assigns to all agents alive at a particular
time decays slower in time than the weight one assigns to oneself. But
it also just seems empirically accurate that people seem to discount
more when deciding for themselves than when deciding for other
people.</p>
<p>Combining the two subclaims, we conclude that people make voting
decisions with a significantly smaller effective discount rate than the
one used for personal decisions.</p>
<h2 id="parenting-as-setting-up-less-myopic-incentives">Parenting as
setting up less myopic incentives</h2>
<p>As a parent, caring about one’s child with a smaller time discount
rate than the child has for themselves<sup><a
href="#fnf4o56jkbi6i">[44]</a></sup> provides reason to set up an
incentive structure for one’s child which internalizes the externalities
on future versions of the child. For instance, if child+[20 years] would
benefit from being better at math, then that’s a reason to reward
child-now for learning math. One can sort of think of parents as
merchants facilitating trades<sup><a
href="#fndn5jur9e1kd">[45]</a></sup> between child+[20 years] and
child-now.</p>
<p>Optimal pricing of these externalities is easier to think about if we
consider child-20-years-from-now to be a roughly fixed agent independent
of our actions, i.e. with fixed preferences. But what if there are
versions of child-20-years-from-now that end up being violinists who
think it’s really great child-from-their-past learned how to play the
violin, but there are also versions of child-20-years-from-now who did
not learn to play the violin and do not think of not having done so as a
big loss either? One can dissolve this by noting that what we care about
is the expected value of our child’s future, i.e. expected value of the
personal utility of the self that is realized, and we can sensibly
reason about changes now that are likely to change this expected value
(that said, we might want to assign different weights to different
future versions based on e.g. mental similarity, or if we dislike
wireheaders).</p>
<p>A final observation: such rewards should generally decrease as the
child’s time horizon broadens, because they start to discount less.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="double-counting-in-externality-internalization">Double counting
in externality internalization</h2>
<p>Here are two cases that stand interestingly in contrast to each
other.</p>
<p>In the first case, suppose the state pays children for being kind to
their parents (with the money coming from the general tax pool,
i.e. with no increase in taxes for parents whose children are nice),
exactly internalizing the positive externality to the parents. Suppose
further that a child still feels that being nice is just barely not
worth it. Would a parent be interested in paying the child 1 dollar for
being nice if that tips the scale? (Note that this would constitute
overcompensating for the externality, leading to a deadweight loss.)</p>
<p>In the second case, suppose a parent does no time discounting for
their child, and the state has an incentive structure in place that
rewards children for learning which appropriately captures the
externality on future versions of themselves (again, with no
discounting). Would a parent still be interested in setting up an
additional incentive structure that rewards the child for learning?</p>
<p>I claim that even though the situations look superficially similar,
the answer to the first question is yes, whereas the answer to the
second question is no. I will leave making sense of this as one final
exercise to the reader.<sup><a href="#fn6atcyvbh8of">[46]</a></sup></p>

<p>I think the rest of the post makes sense if one remains pretty
agnostic about what “personal utility” means precisely, as long as one
considers the basic idea to be workable, and in particular understands
the distinction with the terminal utility of that person, and I don’t
intend to discuss what <code>$x_i$</code> means at significant length in
this post. But here is a discussion of insignificant length:</p>
<p>I think of <code>$x_i$</code> as being the dumbest sensible thing
that captures the idea of being linear in the number of equally
pleasurable experiences (where I’m assuming that pleasurability already
captures the effect of instrumental considerations like getting bored).
If you like, the unit of <code>$x_i$</code> could be a marginal
neg-dustspeck in the eye of the median person in
annoyance-derived-from-dustspecks. The calibration of various
experiences to a common metric within one agent can be estimated by
offering it, or a computationally more powerful version of it, various
tradeoffs between lotteries involving cases where it knows the only
conscious whose experiences are affected is itself, or asking it to
condition its answers on solipsism.<sup><a
href="#fnp3oszdo2ti">[47]</a></sup> One unit of utility could maybe be
calibrated between two agents by trying to estimate the tradeoff they
would accept from behind a veil of ignorance; maybe by doing some crazy
thing with Neuralink; maybe by coming up with some model for predicting
the intensity of various experiences in various people, for instance by
tracking people over time and asking them to consider tradeoffs between
current and past versions of themselves; maybe by setting up some
appropriate economic game; maybe by experimenting on twins; maybe by
using just noticeable differences. Adjust for likely biases. Potentially
do something somewhat wackier for wackier moral patients. Or perhaps we
will be successful in constructing a neat theory of which computations
or field configurations correspond to good experiences.</p>
<p>I admit that I still haven’t quite defined this “personal utility”,
at least not in the sense of reducing it to more basic concepts. At
least for now, I’m fine with it being a theoretical concept that relates
in various ways to other stuff. I guess this is also mostly what I think
about “up quark”, “force”, “belief”, and so on. If this strikes you as
appallingly anti-realist: consider replacing these last few sentences
with a semantic externalist thing and proceeding.</p>
<p>By the way, given that one has worked out the details of the above, I
don’t think there is any additional coefficient that results need to be
multiplied by to account for complexity/level of
consciousness/intelligence of each agent. I think the above methodology
would already take this into account correctly. The process would output
that the value of a typical human experience is (at least) an order of
magnitude larger in absolute value than the value of a typical bee
experience. That said, figuring out this complexity-dependence might
well be a crucial part of the above process.</p></li>
<li><p><sup><strong>[^](#fnrefpvgx1cm14ai)</strong></sup></p>
<p>You can think of <code>$x_i$</code> as a real number (which makes
sense if we are implicitly operating with a single history of the world,
or more narrowly a single history of experiences of <code>$i$</code>,
from the beginning of time till the end of time, in mind), or as a
function from the set of possible world-histories (or the set of
possible experience-histories) to <code>$\mathbb{R}$</code>. I hope

equivocation error involving personal utility and terminal utility.

<p>This is clearly related to <a
href="http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersDB/Harsanyi_(JPolE_55).pdf">Harsanyi’s
Utilitarianism Theorem</a>. In fact, I see this theorem as providing
strong justification for having a terminal utility function of this form
– the philosophical setting here is somewhat different than the setting
Harsanyi appears to have had in mind in the paper, but I think the
assumptions of the theorem are quite compelling in our setting.</p>
<p>To explain the difference in setting: it appears to me that Harsanyi
was thinking of the terminal utilities (or rational preferences) of each
agent as being given, and showing that some assumptions then constrain a
social welfare function into having a certain form. By the way, I
actually think his Postulate c is incorrect (or well, unappealing) in
this philosophical context, with there being compelling counterexamples
similar to the main example I provide in the subsection on Pareto
improvements.</p>
<p>Here is what I currently believe is an explicit counterexample to his
Postulate c (but I recommend reading the rest of this section of my post
first and then returning here): let the weight graph be the directed
version of a big <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)">star</a>, with
everyone really caring about the guy in the middle, and the guy in the
middle only sort of caring about each other agent; offer this set of
agents the contract of <code>$+1$</code> personal utility to the middle
guy and <code>$-1$</code> personal utility to everyone else; I will
leave it to the interested reader to figure out weights in each
direction so that everyone is indifferent about this contract; however,
it seems clear to me that this contract is really bad from the
perspective of a social planner.</p></li>

<p>To be precise: randomness over world-histories makes
<code>$u_i$</code> into a random variable, and <code>$i$</code> is of
course maximizing the expectation of the random variable
<code>$u_i$</code>. (I won’t specify the decision theory with much
precision, because I don’t think anything in this post hinges on it, but
if one is causally minded, one might want to only look at only the
contribution of everything from the future here. Or, this becomes
vacuous if one decides in the next section to assign weight 0 to all

<code>$w_{ii}=1$</code> without loss of generality, because maximizing
<code>$u_i$</code> is equivalent to maximizing
<code>$v\_i=\frac{u\_i}{w_{ii}}.$</code> The weights don’t have any
“physical meaning”, but ratios of weights do have a “physical meaning”.
For instance, <code>$\frac{w_{ij}}{w_{ii}}=\frac{1}{2}$</code> iff

For the above claim to fully make sense, one needs to specify the personal utilities, since otherwise the model&#39;s prescriptions are not fully specified, which makes it unclear how we should be calculating its distance to CEV – by distance, what I had in mind was something like the number of disagreements on some representative set of decision problems, or a sum of all the badnesses of the verdicts (where badness is measured by the difference of the CEV-utility of the best option versus the option chosen by the proposed model), or the `$L^2$` norm of the difference of the CEV-utility and the `$L^2$`-distance-minimizing affine transformation of the model-utility (this assumes a measure on the space of all worlds), or how much worse the world would be (in terms of CEV-utility) if one perfectly followed the advice of model-utility instead of CEV-utility in one&#39;s decisions.

I endorse the claim with the personal utilities in this model being what I proposed in a previous footnote.

<pre><code>Actually, there is a way to justify a kind of deontological principle as a heuristic for utility maximization, at least for a completely altruistic agent. For concreteness, consider the question of whether to recycle (or whether to be vegan for environmental reasons (the same approach also works for animal welfare, although in this case the negative effect is less diffuse and easier to grasp directly), or whether to engage in some high-`$\text{CO}_2$`-emission-activity, or possibly whether to lie, etc.). It seems like the positive effect from recycling to each other agent is tiny, so maybe it can be safely ignored, so recycling has negative utility?^[\[48\]](#fnx1vfqvx8tjn)^ I think this argument is roughly as bad as saying that the number of people affected is huge, so the positive effect must be infinite. A tiny number times a large number is sometimes a reasonably-sized number – even at the extremes, size can matter.

A better first-order way to think of this is the following. Try to imagine a world in which everyone recycles, and one in which no one does. Recycle iff you&#39;d prefer the former to the latter. This is a lot like the categorical imperative. What justifies this equivalence? Consider the process of going from a world where no one recycles to a world where everyone does, switching people from non-recycler to recycler one by one. We will make a linearity assumption, saying that each step along the way changes total welfare by the same amount. It follows that one person becoming a recycler changes total welfare by a positive amount iff a world in which everyone recycles has higher total welfare than a world in which no one does. So if one is completely altruistic (i.e. maximizes total welfare), then one should become a recycler iff one prefers a world where everyone is a recycler.

I think the main benefit of this is that it makes the tradeoff easier to imagine, at least in some cases. Here are three final remarks on this:

1) If our agent is not completely altruistic, then one can still understand diffuse effects in this way, except one needs to add a multiplier on one side of the equation. E.g. if one assigns a weight of `$1/10$` to everyone else, then one should compare the current world to a world in which everyone recycles, but with the diffuse benefits from recycling being only `$1/10$` of what they actually are.

2) We might deviate from linearity, but we can often understand this deviation. E.g. early vegans probably have a superlinear impact because of promoting veganism.

3) See [this](https://twitter.com/wtgowers/status/1564496390516097024?s=20&amp;t=PXwk-V_mmMrA_-jpNg1l-Q) for discussion of an alternative similar principle.</code></pre>

By a Pareto improvement, we mean a trade that any agent whose personal utility is affected would agree to, not a trade that any agent whose terminal utility is affected would agree to.

<pre><code>In many situations, this correlates quite well with the agents being equally wealthy. The idea is that a rich person could transfer a tiny fraction of their wealth, hence only incurring a slight personal utility cost, to a poor person, while increasing the personal utility of the poor person enormously, whereas any transfer of wealth in the opposite direction would hurt the poor person much more than it would benefit the rich person. The bidirectionally possible exchange rates in this case are bounded quite far away from `$1:1$`, so we would see this pair as having vastly different power levels under our formalism, and I think this matches our intuitive notion of power levels as well.

I think this also holds up when the extremal rates of exchange are achieved by things stranger than wealth transfers, like in the manager-employee relationship (especially if there is a significant principal-agent-misalignment between the manager and the company), in the \[government official\]-citizen relationship (especially if the official is significantly misaligned with the state), or in the teacher-student relationship (again, especially if the teacher is misaligned with the school).</code></pre>

<pre><code>Assuming zero transaction costs, having equal power levels is a transitive relation, at least assuming one is allowed to propose a sequence of multiple trades (i.e. contract involving multiple people) in &quot;turning one&#39;s own personal utility into the personal utility of the other&quot;, so it defines an equivalence relation. Given transaction costs, stuff becomes trickier. I think transaction costs should decrease as the number of similar-power-pairs increases, and conditional on the number of pairs staying the same, as the similar-power-graph becomes a better expander. Saying something non-vague in this direction would be interesting. (Also, it feels like there could be some business ideas here?)</code></pre>

<pre><code>Actually, I lied here. I believe this argument works for selfish agents, but not necessarily for terminally caring agents, at least not with the notion of good the maximizing of which matters (i.e. the argument fails if we care about the sum of personal utilities; the argument might work if we care about the sum of terminal utilities, but I consider it incorrect to do so). I nevertheless think that the big claim from this paragraph is mostly correct; my true justification is a hope that the result from the simple selfish case reasonably extends to the messy case where people can care about each other.

Actually, when these conditions are satisfied (which is suspicious, and it is especially suspicious that this would be preserved over time as e.g. the more capable or better-positioned agents become richer, but let&#39;s proceed), I guess it could only be the case that more caring decreases the total utility achieved compared to the case where everyone is selfish, but with a return to guaranteed optimality in the extremum where everyone is totally altruistic. So in this regime, I hereby reverse my earlier guess about more caring being better. My updated general guess is the following: more caring is good between agents at different power levels, and much less important (or perhaps as likely to be bad as good) between agents at similar power levels.

<pre><code>I think the justification I would give for externalities not being that much of a problem (w.r.t. achieving maximum social welfare) otherwise is essentially the same as in our earlier discussion on when Kaldor-Hicks improvements can be transformed into Pareto improvements. (Also see the [Coase theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem).) As earlier, I think such an argument only works if the agents are selfish (and also if there are no issues with information and bargaining, which I am taking to be subsumed by the assumption that transaction costs are low).</code></pre>

<pre><code>A subsidy on `$A$` is sort of just a negative tax on `$A$`. It&#39;s also sort of just a tax on not-`$$``$A$`. I think most economics things about taxes generalize to subsidies in both of these ways without changing any of the math. But I could imagine an argument that there is some significant behavioral economics type (irrational) difference, sort of like (I would guess) there is an empirical difference between how people treat paying for bus tickets vs paying for penalty charges for not having a ticket. (There are of course also rational reasons for not just comparing \[ticket price\] to \[penalty fare times probability of getting caught\], e.g. having to waste some time, but I&#39;m guessing that there is a big empirical difference even after we count these as costs.)</code></pre>

<pre><code>The plots on page 362 [here](http://www.christosaioannou.com/Frederick,%20Loewenstein%20and%20O&#39;Donoghue%20(2002).pdf) (page 12 in the pdf) look like reasonably strong evidence of this, although I have some uncertainty regarding whether the studies were any good at capturing utility discounting (in particular, did not fall for something stupid like ignoring the fact that people are likely to be richer when older and hence value money less), or in fact about whether this was even what they were trying to do. I have not spent sufficient time on this to be reasonably certain about this empirical question. I will try to update the post if someone points out in the comments that one can&#39;t deduce the existence of time discounting from this data.

One problem I anticipate with these plots is that they might not be accounting for uncertainty about one&#39;s future existence, which is a commonly cited reason for instrumental time discounting, and which would not constitute time discounting in the sense relevant to this subsection of my post. That said, I don&#39;t expect there to be a rational way to get the high discount rates indicated by the plots from instrumental discounting of this kind alone.

(By the way, the plots include a data point where the discount rate seems to be graphically indistinguishable from 1, which seems interesting. (In fact, I&#39;d put like &gt;1% probability on that being the one study in this sample that correctly captured non-instrumental time discounting in utility...)

<pre><code>I could see a counter-claim here saying that people still seem to vote for policies according to what benefits them individually. This could be because people are irrational, or because they are computationally limited and this is a heuristic, or because this is part of the perceived rules of the voting game (I would guess that many analyses of voting decisions assume that each person is voting according to a decision rule with a majority of the total weight on themselves or their family). One could make the plausible counter-counter-claim that perhaps a better description of what&#39;s going on is that people are trying to vote according to a decision rule with a majority of the total weight on other people (or more strictly people distant in the social graph), but it just often ends up being what&#39;s good for themselves, perhaps because of something like the [typical situation fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy), but in a way which still makes the rest of this argument go through (perhaps because one is still less myopic when deciding for these other versions of oneself). But even if that counter-counter-claim fails, what we need for this argument is actually the much weaker claim the sum of weights assigned to other people is at least on the same order of magnitude as the weight assigned to oneself, which strikes me as eminently reasonable.</code></pre>
