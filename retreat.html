<h1 id="linear-algebra-retreat-2023">Linear algebra retreat 2023</h1>
<p>With Maria Kostylew, Kirke Joamets, and Kaarel Hänni as the
organizing team<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, and with Hugo
Eberhard, Richard Luhtaru, and Kaarel Hänni as lecturer-TAs, and with a
total of 13 and average of ~9 other participants (most of whom are
Kaarel’s research collaborators and/or friends), we ran an informal
1-week linear algebra retreat [04-11]/08/2023 in Atla, Saaremaa,
Estonia. The point of the retreat was to teach participants a few
‘intermediate topics’ in linear algebra, in part to gain more comfort
with linear algebra more generally, as well as to co-work or just
rest.</p>
<h2 id="lecture-notes-for-the-main-curriculum">Lecture notes for the
main curriculum</h2>
<p>Main content days had 1-2 hours of lecture followed by an arbitrary
number of hours of working on problem sets individually or in groups,
with assistance from TAs if desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singular Value Decomposition (theory) — Kaarel: <a
href="./doc/svd.pdf">lecture notes</a> | <a
href="./doc/svd-pset.pdf">password-protected problem set</a></li>
<li>Singular Value Decomposition (practical) — Richard: <a
href="./doc/svd.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a> | <a
href="./doc/svd-solutions.ipynb">notebook with partial
solutions</a></li>
<li>Linear Algebra in Combinatorics — Hugo: <a
href="./doc/combinatorics.pdf">lecture notes</a> | <a
href="./doc/combinatorics-pset.pdf">problem set</a></li>
<li>Convexity — Kaarel: <a href="./doc/convexity.pdf">lecture notes</a>
| <a href="./doc/convexity-pset.pdf">password-protected problem
set</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The password for the SVD and convexity problem sets, as well as a <a
href="./doc/review-pset.pdf">pre-retreat review pset</a>, is (probably)
available upon request.<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="other-lectures">Other lectures</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="./doc/borsuk.pdf">Borsuk’s Conjecture and The Chromatic
Number of Euclidean Space</a> — Hugo Eberhard</li>
</ul>
<p>We also had a review pset review session by Kaarel, Richard, and
Hugo; a talk by Taavet Kalda on physics-informed neural nets; an AI
alignment Q&amp;A session by Simon Skade; two talks by Jake Mendel on
topics related to Toy Models of Superposition; a talk by Kaarel on the
combinatorics of vector configurations; a trading Q&amp;A session by
Sahil Baid; and an AI governance talk by Philip Tomei. Other activities
included a day trip to Harilaid, calisthenics led by Walter Laurito,
movie nights, lightning talks in the sauna, a quiz by Kirke and Hugo, a
game of University Challenge hosted by Philip, and many informal
discussions/arguments.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>We’d like to thank the participants for cooking, cleaning, and being
great! I (Kaarel) would particularly like to thank Kirke for fighting
the local increase in entropy in all things physical, Maria for fighting
the local increase in entropy in all things logistical, Jonathan for
fighting the entropy in people’s locations, and Hugo and Richard for
helping participants decrease their entropy in all things
mathematical-conceptual :)</p>
