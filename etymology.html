<h1 id="etymological-enigmas">etymological enigmas</h1>
<p>Each word below presents an etymological puzzle. That is, your task
is to figure out the etymology of each word listed below. By “figuring
out the etymology”, what I have in mind is roughly figuring out what
happened on the step(s) where meaning-making happened; in particular, it
might be less interesting to figure out precisely from what language the
term jumped to what other language, or what letter was dropped compared
to some earlier initial form (though of course these could be
instrumentally useful for solving the semantic puzzle), and more
interesting to try to figure out a step where e.g. two words were
combined into a compound.) For example, if the puzzle is “pineapple”,
then a solution might involve saying that this came about by combining
“pine” and “apple”, and maybe adding that the “pine” part was motivated
by the resemblance with a pinecone. I recommend the wonderful
https://en.wiktionary.org/ for checking answers.</p>
