href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnBUbRowRgM&amp;t=55s">top of the
line</a> physics problems with minimal prereqs</h1>
<p>The following description applies to the union of this post and its
<a href="./problemlets.html">companion post with math problems</a>. A
few of these are original, many are stolen. There are a few problems
here which I independently came up with and later checked that a number
of other people had also come up with the problem. The point of the
problems is not just to guess the right answer, but to also provide a
proof of its correctness (i.e. a compelling argument). A few of the
problems are stated a little vaguely, but I think there is a roughly
unique way to reasonably resolve the vagueness in each case.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You want to be super cool and so on. Your best option for this is to
do a <a href="https://youtu.be/P8V_bx0L4RY">bottle flip</a>. For this,
your friend has put just the right amount of water into a bottle so that
the center of mass of the system consisting of the (upright) bottle and
the water in it is as low as possible. Your friend hands you the bottle
and a marker. Draw a horizontal line on the side of the bottle which
indicates the height of the center of mass of the system.</li>
<li>You’re sort of out of shape, so you need to rest for <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> seconds somewhere on your way to work.
There is an escalator on your way to work. Is it better to rest on the
escalator, or a few steps after it?</li>
<li>The walk from your home to work is <span
class="math inline">\(10\mathrm{km}\)</span>. Your walking speed is
<span class="math inline">\(5\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}\)</span>. Your dog,
however, likes to run at <span
class="math inline">\(10\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}\)</span>. You and your
dog start walking/running from your home, with you just normally walking
to work, but with your dog running to your workplace, back to you, to
your workplace again, back to you, and so on. What’s the total distance
travelled by your dog?</li>
