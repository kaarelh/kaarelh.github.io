<p>I often spend significant chunks of time writing down shortform
thoughts, most often as private messages and emails to friends, as
messages on various Discord/Slack channels, and as comments on various
sites of dubious quality<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>. A friend
noted that a lot of these are actually quite self-contained, and
recommended that I make some public. Even though these are often
contextually motivated (for instance, responding to a particular point
raised by a friend), and definitely far from the optimal thing of their
kind to write for the public, I nevertheless agreed with my friend that
I should attempt to post these — the present page is my attempt to begin
doing so!</p>
