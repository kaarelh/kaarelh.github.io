<h1 id="the-cream-of-the-crop-of-math-problems-with-minimal-prereqs">the
<a href="https://youtu.be/8C4lK41SX-Q">cream of the crop</a> of math
problems with minimal prereqs</h1>
<p>The following description applies to the union of this post and its
<a href="./physprobs.html">companion post with physics problems</a>. A
few of these are original, many are stolen. There are a few problems
here which I independently came up with and later checked that a number
of other people had also come up with the problem. The point of the
problems is not just to guess the right answer, but to also provide a
proof of its correctness (i.e. a compelling argument). A few of the
problems are stated a little vaguely, but I think there is a roughly
unique way to reasonably resolve the vagueness in each case.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You have an <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> chocolate
tablet. You start breaking it into pieces in some arbitrary order. For
instance, you might start by breaking it into an <span
class="math inline">\(m\times 1\)</span> strip and an <span
class="math inline">\(m\times (n-1)\)</span> tablet. You finish when you
can’t make any more cuts, i.e. all the pieces are singletons. How many
cuts did you make?</li>
<li>You have a finite set of points on the plane such that any triangle
formed by three of the points has area at most <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Prove that there is a triangle of area
<span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> which contains every point.</li>
