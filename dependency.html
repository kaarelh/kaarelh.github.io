id="a-dependency-between-whats-going-on-with-consciousness-and-whats-valuable-work-in-progress">A
dependency between what’s going on with consciousness and what’s
valuable (work in progress)</h1>
<p>Suppose we have a digitally implemented mind that looks like a
circuit that’s on the <span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span>-plane
with wires that are vertically thick, extending in thickness from <span
class="math inline">\(z=-\varepsilon\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z=\varepsilon\)</span>. In other words, the
circuit should be like a kinda planar graph for this to make sense, but
I don’t think this is actually crucial – it’s just easier to visualize
this way. There is an analogous way to handle any 3-dimensional circuit.
Further assume that the mind is having a good time. Further assume that
this mind is the only one in the universe.</p>
<p>Now imagine splitting the circuit into two pieces by sliding a thin
knife through the <span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span> plane. Did
the utility of the universe just double? (After all, one might say that
there are now <strong>two</strong> minds having a good time.) We could
imagine this happening while the electrical current remains the same in
each piece of wire, though. It seems weird to think</p>
<p>If we think</p>
<p>I think understanding this better might lead to clarifying some
crucial questions of practical importance. Whether creating a gazillion
copies of the same human/computation multiplies the amount of utility in
the universe by a gazillion</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgments">acknowledgments</h2>
<p>I know I did not come up with this business with thick wires, but I
also have no idea whom to attribute this to. maybe qualia research
institute?</p>
