<h1 id="all-one-needs-to-know-about-spirituality">All one needs to know
about spirituality :)</h1>
<p>It is robustly useful to think about things, and to do so from
multiple directions or with multiple framings or whatever. It is also
robustly useful (for figuring out what the truth is) to find out what
other people think about things. Some people fail to poke at things from
sufficiently many directions unprompted, and are aided by being given
various LARPs to play.</p>
<p>And this explains all the thought-processing usefulness of all of the
following (insofar as there is any usefulness at all – this post is
agnostic about that):</p>
<ul>
<li>religions</li>
<li>meditation</li>
<li>Freudian whatever</li>
<li>focusing (psychotherapy thingy)</li>
<li>actually, psychotherapy in general</li>
<li>auditing (scientology thingy)</li>
<li>tarot card reading</li>
<li>astrology</li>
<li>other kinds of fortune-telling</li>
<li>(etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the rest of the causal mechanisms and (metaphysical)
objects that many presentations of most of these posit make as much
sense as any (non-commonsensical) claims about the world made by
e.g. christianity (i.e. these are bonkers). It is possible that there is
some significant fraction of people who would struggle to think about
things unprompted and who would not think enough about things if these
prompts are presented to them merely as LARPs, though I’m fairly certain
it is still all-things-considered highly wrong to lie to these people
that any of the wacky metaphysics and so on is real.</p>
<p>That said, there are of course significantly better and worse prompts
offered by the above. Sadly, I won’t offer any interesting heuristics
regarding how to identify better and worse prompts. Identifying the more
useful prompts is a worthwhile question for scientific study. My
impression is that rationalists/EAs are generally well-calibrated on
judgments of the usefulness of various prompts, academics are okay, and
the general public is being ridiculous as always.</p>
