<h1 id="infinitude-spreads">2 infinitude spreads</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>An endeavor being infinite often causes other related endeavors to
be infinite. In particular:
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an infinite endeavor,
then “how should one do <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>?” is also
infinite.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> For example: math is infinite, so
“how should one do math?” is infinite; ethics is infinite, so “how
should one do ethics?” is infinite.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an infinite endeavor
and there is a “faithful reduction” of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to another endeavor <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is also infinite. (In particular, if an
infinite endeavor <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is “faithfully”
a subset of another endeavor <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>,
then <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is also infinite.)<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> For example, math being infinite
implies that stuff in general is infinite; “how should one do math?”
being infinite implies that “how should one think?” is infinite.</li>
<li>If an endeavor constitutes a decently big part of an infinite
endeavor, then it is infinite.<sup>[Any non-infinitesimal fraction
should definitely count as a “decently big part”; the reason I didn’t
just say “positive fraction” to begin with is that I’d maybe like this
principle to also helpfully explain why some sufficiently big
infinitesimal fractions of infinite problems are infinite.]</sup>[<em>a
footnote analogous to the first footnote about the first item on this
sublist</em>] For example, to the extent that language is and will
remain to be highly load-bearing in thinking, [figuring out how thinking
should work] being infinite implies that [figuring out how language
should work] is also infinite.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Thinking being infinite can help make some sense of many other
philosophical problems/endeavors being infinite.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
<ol type="1">
<li>Specifically:
<ol type="1">
<li>If “solving” a philosophical problem would entail understanding some
aspect of thinking which has a claim to indefinitely constituting a
decently big part of thinking, then</li>
<li>If “solving” a philosophical problem would entail making a decision
on [how one’s thinking operates in some major aspect], that
philosophical problem is not going to be remotely “solved”, because one
will probably want to majorly change how one’s thinking works in that
major aspect later.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Here are some problems whose infinitude could be explained by the
infinitude of thinking in this way (but whose infinitude could also be
explained in other ways):
<ol type="1">
<li>“how does learning work?”</li>
<li>“how does language work?”</li>
<li>“how should one assign probabilities?”</li>
<li>“what are concepts? which criteria determine whether concepts are
good?”</li>
<li>“how does science work?”</li>
<li>“how should one do mathematics?”</li>
<li>“what is the character of value(ing)?”</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You might feel indifferent about some of these problems; you could
well have a philosophical system in which some of these are not
load-bearing (as I do). My claim is that those problems which are
genuinely load-bearing in your philosophical system are probably
infinite, and their infinitude can be significantly explained by the
infinitude of “how should one think?”.</li>
<li>We could imagine a version of these problems which could be solved
— for example, one might construct a GOFAI system which has a
(kinda-)language+meaning which is plausibly load-bearing for it but
which will not be reworked. My claim is that for a mind which will
indefinitely be thinking better, if it has “language” and “meaning”, to
the extent these are load-bearingly sticking around indefinitely, the
mind will also “want to” majorly rework them indefinitely.</li>
<li>Again, all this is very much not to say that one cannot make
progress on these philosophical problems — even though any progress will
be infinitesimal for these infinite endeavors, one can make substantive
progress on them (just like one can make substantive progress in math),
and I think humanity is in fact continuously making substantive progress
on them. So, for many philosophical problems/endeavors <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, I can get behind “we’re pretty much no
closer to solving <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> now than we
were 2000 years ago” — meaning that only an infinitesimal fraction has
been solved, just like earlier, or that only a finite amount has been
figured out, with a real infinity still remaining, just like earlier —
while very much disagreeing with the possible followup “that is, we
haven’t made any progress on <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
since 2000 years ago” — I think probably more than half of the
philosophical progress up until now happened since 1700, and maybe even
just since 1875.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Saying these problems are infinite because of the infinitude of “how
should one think?” can make it seem like we are viewing ourselves very
much “from the outside” when tackling these problems and when tackling
“how should one think?”, but I also mean to include tackling these
problems more “from the inside”.
<ol type="1">
<li>What do I mean by tackling these problems “from the outside” vs
“from the inside”? Like, on the extreme of tackling a problem “from the
outside”, you could maybe imagine examining (yourself as) another
thinking-system out there, having its language and beliefs and various
thought-structures somehow made intelligible to you, with you trying to
figure out what eg its concept of “existence” should be reworked to.
Tackling “the same problem” from the inside could look like having
various intuitions about existence and trying to find a way to specify
what it means for something to exist in terms of other vocabulary such
that these intuitions are met (this can feel like taking “existence” to
already be some thing, just without you having a clear sense of what it
is). And a sorta intermediate example: asking yourself why you want a
notion of “existence”, trying to answer that by examining cases where
your actions (or thinking more broadly) would depend on that notion, and
seeking to first make sense of how to operate in those cases in some way
that routes through existence less. Of course, in practice, we always
have/do an amalgam of the inside and outside thing.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li>I’m saying that the infinitude of [such investigations which are
more from the inside of a conceptual schema] could also be partly
explained by the infinitude of “how should thinking work?”.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Wanting to rework one’s system of thought indefinitely is also a
reason for keeping constituent structures provisional.</li>

<li id="fn1"><p>The weaker claim that I could make here is that this is
only true typically — i.e., that “if <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is infinite, then”how should one do
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>?” is usually also infinite. I
think the weaker claim would be fine to support the rest of the
discussion, but I’ve decided to go with the stronger claim for now as it
still seems plausible. To adapt an ancient biology olympiad adage: it
might be that all universally quantified statements are false, but the
ones that are nearly true are worth their weight in gold. Anyway, I
admit that the claim being true ends up depending on how one measures
progress on a problem (as discussed briefly also in the last item),
which I haven’t properly specified. For these notes, I would like to
keep getting away with saying we’re measuring progress in some intuitive
way which is like the way mathematicians measure progress when saying
math is infinite.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I think the metaethical problem of providing sth like
axioms for ethics is also infinite, despite the fact that it could be
reasonable to consider the analogous problem for math finite given that
we can develop (almost) all our math inside [first-order logic]+ZFC. One
relevant difference between this metamathematical problem and this
metaethical problem is that any system which supports sufficiently rich
structure can be a fine solution to the metamathematical problem because
we can then probably make <span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span>all our mathematical objects sit
inside that system, whereas it is far from being the case that anything
goes to this extent for the metaethical problem — it being fine to use
the hypothetical ethical system to guide action feels like a much
stricter requirement on it, and in fact probably entangles the choice
with ethics sufficiently to make this problem infinite, also.
Additionally, it being imo plausibly infinite to make some decision on
what the character of value is also pushes this metaethical problem
toward infinitude. What’s more, such a formal system would not only need
to “contain” our values, but also our understanding (I will talk more
about this in a later note), but our understanding is probably not
something on which any fixing decision should ever be made because we
should remain open to thinking in new ways, so any hypothetical such
system would be going out of date after it is created (at least in its
“understanding-component”, but I also doubt a principled cleavage can be
made (I’ll discuss various reasons in upcoming notes)). Also, our
understanding and values at any time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are also probably much too big for us
to see properly at that time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, as
well as not in a format to fit in any canonically-shaped such system.
That said, there is a “small problem of providing an ethical system”
which just asks for any kind of “system” which is sorta fine to give
control to according to one’s values (relative to some default), which
is solvable because e.g. humanity-tomorrow will be such a system for
humanity.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>By <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> reducing to
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, I roughly mean the usual thing
from computer science: that there is a cheap/easy way to get a solution
to <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> from a solution to <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>; this implies that if you could solve
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, you could also solve <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. If we conceive of each endeavor as
consisting of collecting/solving some kinds of pieces, then we could
also require a piece-wise map here: that for each piece of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, one can cheaply specify a piece of
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> such that having solved/collected
that piece of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> would make it cheap
for one to solve/collect that piece of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> as well. I’m adding the further
condition that the reduction be “faithful” to rule out cases where a
full solution to <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> would give you a
solution to <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, but one can
nevertheless get a positive fraction of the way in <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> without doing anything remotely as
challenging as <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> — for example,
take <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to be the disjoint union of
playing a game of tic-tac-toe and math, with equal total importance
assigned to each, and take <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to be
math. I’m not sure what I should mean by a reduction being “faithful” (a
central criterion on its meaning is just to make the statement about
transferring infinitude true), but here are a few alternatives: (1) If
we can think of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in terms of collecting pieces with
importance-measures in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{\geq
0}\)</span>, then it would be sufficient to require that the reduction
map doesn’t distort the measures outrageously. (2) We could say that any
<span class="math inline">\([\geq\frac13]\)</span>-solution of <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> would cheaply yield a <span
class="math inline">\([\geq c]\)</span>-solution (with <span
class="math inline">\(c&gt;0\)</span>) of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, or that any way to remotely-well-solve
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> would cheaply give rise to a way
to remotely-well-solve <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, but this
is plausibly too strong a requirement. (3) We could say that if there
were a <span class="math inline">\([\geq\frac13]\)</span>-solution of
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, there would be another solution
of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> which isn’t “infinitely many
times more challenging (to find)” which would cheaply yield a <span
class="math inline">\([\geq c]\)</span>-solution (with <span
class="math inline">\(c&gt;0\)</span>) of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. In other words, we’d say that there is
a reasonably economical way to go about <span
class="math inline">\([\geq \frac13]\)</span>-solving <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> which would involve <span
class="math inline">\([\geq c]\)</span>-solving <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> as well. Actually, for most
infinitude-transfers one might want to handle with this rule, I think it
might also be fine to do without a “precise” statement, just appealing
to how <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is intuitively at least as
challenging as <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.<a href="#fnref3"

<li id="fn4"><p>Is the infinitude of “how should one think?” the “main
reason” why philosophy is infinite? Is it the main reason for most
particular infinite philosophical problems being infinite? I would guess
that it is not — that there are also other important reasons; in
particular, if a philosophical problem is infinite, I would expect there
to at least also be some reason for its infinitude which is “more
internal to it”. In fact, I suspect that clarifying the [reasons
why]/[ways in which] endeavors can end up infinite is itself an infinite
endeavor :).<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>In addition to stuff done by people canonically
considered philosophers (who have also made a great deal of progress),
I’d certainly include as central examples of philosophical progress many
of the initial intellectual steps which led to the creation of the
following fields: probability and statistics, thermodynamics and
statistical mechanics, formal mathematical logic, computability and
computer science, game theory, cybernetics, information theory,
computational complexity theory, AI, machine learning, and probably many
others; often, this involved setting up an arena in which one could find
clear/mathematical counterparts to some family of previously vague
questions. (I’d also consider many later intellectual steps in these
fields to be philosophical progress.)<a href="#fnref5"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Doing some amount of the inside thing is hard to avoid
because we can’t access ourselves except from the inside, and even if we
had some other access channel, we’d struggle to operate well on an
aspect of ourselves except by playing around with it on the inside a
bunch — think also about eg how to help someone out of a confusion
(about a theorem, say), it can help to try to think in that confused way
yourself, and eg how playing a game (or at least seeing it played) is
centrally good for improving it. Some amount of the outside thing is
also usually unavoidable — we are reflective by default and that’s good
— think eg about how it is actually good/necessary to also look at a
game from the outside to improve it, not to just keep playing it (though
a human will of course be doing a great deal of looking at the game even
when just playing it), and about why it’s good that we are able to talk
about propositions and not solely about more thingy things (or, well,
about why it’s good we can turn propositions into ordinary thingy
things)<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"

class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Really, I’m somewhat unhappy with the language I have
here — “how should thinking work?” sounds too much like we’re only
taking the external position. I would like to have something which makes
it clearer that we have here is like a game at once played and
improved.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
