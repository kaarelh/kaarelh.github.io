math, thinking, and technology are equi-infinite</a></h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>If one of math, understanding intelligence, and inventing useful
technologies is infinite, then so are the other two. (An argument for
this is given in items 2–6 of this list.)
<ol type="1">
<li>So, if you think any one of the three is infinite, then you should
also think that the other two are. In particular, if you’re on board
with my earlier assertion that math is infinite, then you should also
agree that thinking and technology are infinite. Or you could prima
facie buy into technology being infinite, and get to thinking that
thinking and math are infinite from there.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If math is infinite, then “how should one do math?” is infinite.
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>I could just appeal to note 2 item 1.1 to justify this, but it makes
sense to also justify this independently (especially given that I
haven’t justified 2.1.1 well). (Also, if we went with the definition of
an infinite endeavor in 1.4.3(.1), then we’d be done by definition here,
but that’s not too exciting, either.)</li>
<li>I guess I’d first like to try to get you to recognize that if you
accepted my earlier assertion that math is infinite, then you might have
already sorta accepted that doing math is infinite, at least in the
following sense:
<ol type="1">
<li>If we think of math-the-more-object-level-endeavor as being
ultimately about printing proofs of propositions, then we should
plausibly already think of say, mathematical ideas (e.g., the idea of a
probabilistic construction) or mathematical objects/constructions (e.g.,
a vector space) or frames/arenas organizing mathematical fields (e.g.,
the scheme-theoretic organization of algebraic geometry) as meta-level
things — they are like tools one uses to print proofs better.</li>
<li>This isn’t to say that math is in fact ultimately well-thought-of as
not also being about defining objects and coming up with new ideas and
so on. But I want to get across the sense that these live in significant
part also on the meta-level — that they are not just things in the
object-domain, but also components of us doing math. Getting further in
math centrally involves gaining these tools, from others or by making
them yourself.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Quite generally, given that understanding a domain better blends
together with thinking better in the domain to a significant extent, if
you think there’s an infinitely rich variety of things to understand in
mathematics, this gives you some reason to think that there is also an
infinitely rich variety of structure to employ in doing mathematics, so
it gives you some reason to think that figuring out how one should do
math is an infinite endeavor.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If “how should one do math?” is infinite, then “how should one
think?” is also infinite.
<ol type="1">
<li>We could just say this is a special case of 2.1.2 (i.e., item 1.2
from Note 2), but it also makes sense to justify this separately/again.
I think it’d be super bizarre for mathematical thinking and thinking in
general not to be equi-infinite; it’d be particularly bizarre for
getting better at thinking to be infinitely “easier” than getting better
at mathematical thinking. They are just way too similar (in the relevant
aspect(s)). It’s not like math researchers use thinking in some
profoundly different class when doing math (compared to when doing other
thinking). Things in general are way too much like math way too much of
the time. Doing things in general involves doing math way too
centrally.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If “how should one think?” is infinite, then tech is also infinite.
<ol type="1">
<li>The question “how should one think?” is/[centrally involves] the
question “which thinking-[structures/technologies] should one
make/use?”, so this latter question is then also infinite (maybe by
2.1.3). And “thinking-technologies” are (“faithfully”) a subset of all
technologies, so tech is also infinite by 2.1.2.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Finally, if tech is infinite, then math is infinite.
<ol type="1">
<li>The vibes are very similar, in the relevant way.</li>
<li>In particular, technological objects are a lot like mathematical
objects. From this, one might think that tech is like a fragment of
math, in which case one might think that math could only be more
infinite than tech, appealing to 2.1.2.</li>
<li>But also, our mathematical ideas “show up load-bearingly” all over
the place in our technologies, so one could try to see math as a
fragment of tech and to infer its infinitude from the infinitude of tech
using 2.1.3.</li>
<li>Actually, our math just is one kind of tech we’re building (for our
thinking and also for other doings) — this gives another way to see math
as a subendeavor of tech for us, and one can then again try to infer its
infinitude using 2.1.3.</li>
<li>Additionally, math shows up load-bearingly in developing tech, so
one could infer the infinitude of developing tech from the infinitude of
tech using 2.1.1 and then infer the infinitude of math from that using
2.1.3.</li>
<li>Let us say more about math and tech having similar vibes (in the
relevant way). One could tell many stories to communicate that the vibes
are similar; here are the premises of a few:
<ol type="1">
<li>Mathematical objects are often invented/discovered to do things, to
[participate in]/support/[make possible] our (mathematical) activities,
and to help us with problems/projects — just like (other) technological
objects.</li>
<li>One can think of a technology in terms of its
construction/composition/design/[internal structure], like an engineer
might, or one can think of a technology in terms of [its
function(s)]/[its purpose(s)]/[what one can do with it]/[how to use
it]/[what it is like as it operates]/[its properties]/[how it relates to
other things]/[the surrounding external structure]<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
like one usually does when thinking about doing stuff with the
technology. This is also true of mathematical devices — for example, one
can think of the real numbers in terms of their construction (e.g. as
Cauchy sequences of rationals<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> or Dedekind cuts of
rationals), or one can instead think of the real numbers as <a
href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/362991/137945">a complete ordered
field</a>, or as being involved in geometry and analysis in various
ways, etc.; one can think of the homology groups of a topological space
in terms of their construction (e.g. via <a
href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">the simplicial
route or the singular route</a>), or one can instead think of homology
groups as things of which the various theorems in <a
href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Hatcher</a>
involving homologies are true (indeed, one can pin down the homology of
a space uniquely as the thing satisfying some axioms — see Section 2.3
and Theorem 4.59 in <a
href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Hatcher</a><a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>); one can think of a product of
topological spaces as having tuples as points and having its topology
generated by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_set">cylinder sets</a>, or
as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)#Product_of_an_arbitrary_family">a
canonical topological space equipped with continuous maps to the
original spaces</a>.</li>
<li>One can also just be using a technology without thinking about it
much (for example, you can be using your laptop to write notes without
thinking about your laptop much), and one can also be using a
mathematical thing in one’s thinking without thinking about it much (for
example, you can be doing stuff with real numbers without explicitly
thinking about how their construction or even their properties).
(However, a difference: there is structure supporting/[involved in] your
use of your laptop which lives outside your head, whereas the structure
involved in your use of a vector space lives <span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span>entirely in your head.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Note that the implications about infinitude in items 2-5 on this
list form a loop, so we’ve provided an argument that these endeavors are
equi-infinite. More precisely, we’ve given an argument that if any one
of these problems/endeavors is infinite, then any other is also
infinite; this means that they are either all finite or all infinite.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li>You might say: “Okay, I agree that there’s a genuine infinity of
mathematical objects (and so on), a genuine infinity of technologies,
and a genuine infinity of thinking-technologies in particular. But
couldn’t there be a level above all these infinite messes where there’s
some simple thing?”. My short answer is: no, e.g. our handling of
mathematical objects is technological/organic throughout. A longer
answer:
<ol type="1">
<li>For example, let’s look at making concepts.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Making concepts looks e.g. like having a <a
href="https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LSG/Projects/lvg/current/docs/designDoc/UDF/derivations/suffixList.html">varied</a>
<a href="https://nagelhout.faculty.unlv.edu/AGiC/s4d.html">system</a>
for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_derivation">morphological
derivation</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection">inflection</a>, giv-ing
parti-cul-ar ab(i)-(bi)li(s)-ti-es to pro-duce con-cep-t-s. Here are
some more example high-level ways in which new concepts can be found:
<ol type="1">
<li>become familiar with many toy cases; push yourself to see them as
clearly as possible; if any objects show up, try to see if they can also
be used in other contexts;</li>
<li>when you have a toy setting worked out, ask what “auxiliary
constructions”/“nontrivial ideas” were involved<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>;</li>
<li>generalize existing things; unify existing things; articulate
similarities; find what’s responsible for similarities;</li>
<li>make existing looser notions more precise; make distinctions;</li>
<li>get concepts for a novel context via analogy to some familiar
context;</li>
<li>look for a thing which would “work” a certain way; look for a thing
which would play a certain role<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>;</li>
<li>more generally, have some constraints on a hypothetical thing in
mind and look for a concrete thing which would satisfy those
constraints;</li>
<li>in particular, for various particular relations or functions, look
for what stands in that relation with some thing or what that function
takes some thing to;</li>
<li>in particular, look for the (logical) cause of some property or
event;</li>
<li>look for ways you can relate something to other things; look for
things you can do with it; look for ways to transform it;</li>
<li>enumerate all things of some kind and see if any are useful.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Making concepts can look a lot like making (more explicit)
technologies, in which surely very much of our thinking is importantly
involved.</li>
<li>Also, I’d sorta object to thinking there is a level “above” this
messy world of concepts. There are surely structures present in
us-doing-math beyond easily visible mathematical concepts, including
structures of different kinds, but instead of thinking of these
structures as handling and organizing concepts from above, I think it’s
better to think of the whole thinking-shebang as like an organic thing,
so this sounds e.g. like thinking that [blood circulation]/[the
cardiovascular system] is a structure “above” the organs, or like saying
a tree is a structure organizing koalas. Additionally, the structure
surrounding a concept is in significant part [given by]/[made of] other
concepts.</li>
<li>You might say: “hmm, you’re talking about all these things we can
easily see, but couldn’t there be a nice hidden structure which handles
things? like, a structure in the brain?”.
<ol type="1">
<li>Well, I certainly have been talking about those things we can see
better, and there are surely many structures in our
thinking-activities<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> that we can’t see that clearly at
present. It seems unlikely that there’d be these central hidden things
of a fundamentally different character than the various technological
things we can see, though.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You might say: “hmm, maybe thinking is this organic-technological
mess now, but couldn’t it become well-organized? couldn’t there be some
sort of formula for thinking which remains to be discovered/reified?”.
Or maybe you might say: “hmm, maybe thinking is an organic-technological
mess, but couldn’t it really be a shadow of a very nice thing?”
<ol type="1">
<li>There are surely nice things shadowed in thinking. For example,
(almost all) clear human mathematical statements and clear mathematical
proofs (especially from after like 1950 or whatever) have formal
counterparts in ZFC — there’s a very real “near-isomorphism” of an
important thing in human mathematical (thinking-)activities with a nice
formal thing. For another example, there are ways to see bayesianism
(usually combined with other interesting “ideas”) in various things from
(frequentist) statistical methods to plant behavior<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
It can often be helpful to understand something about the actual thing
by evoking the nice thing; it is in some contexts appropriate to think
almost entirely about a nice thing to figure out something about the
actual thing. But I think there are very many nice things shadowed in
thinking, with developing thinking continuing to shadow more cool things
on all levels indefinitely.</li>
<li>This seems close to asking whether the (technological) world would
eventually just “have” one kind of thing. And it seems unlikely that it
would!</li>
<li>There will probably continue to be a very rich variety of
(thinking-)structures in use.</li>
<li>If I had to guess at some single higher “structure” centrally
“behind/in” thinking, I’d say “one is creative; one finds/invents and
finds uses for (thinking-)structures”.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
But I don’t think this is some sort of definite/simple thing — I think
this will again be rich, involving many “ideas”.</li>
<li>I’ve tried to say more in response to these questions in the next
few notes.</li>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>The object/meta distinction is sort of weird to maintain
here; its weirdness has to do with us being reflective creatures, always
thinking together about a domain and about us [thinking about]/[doing
stuff in] the domain. When you are engaged in any challenging activity,
you’re not solely “making very object-level moves”, but also thinking
about the object-level moves you’re making; now, of course, the thinking
about object-level moves you’re making can also itself naturally be seen
as consisting of moves in that challenging activity, blurring the line
between object-level-moves and meta-moves. And I’m just saying this is
true in particular for challenging thinking-activities; in such
activities, the object-moves are already more like thought-moves, and
the meta-moves are/constitute/involve thinking about your thinking
(though you needn’t be very explicitly aware that this is what you’re
doing, and you often won’t be). A mathematician doesn’t just “print
statements” without looking at the “printing process”, but is
essentially always simultaneously seeking to improve the “printing
process”. And this isn’t at all unique to mathematics — when a scientist
or a philosopher asks a question, they also ask how to go about
answering that question, seek to make the question make more sense,
etc.. (However, it is probably moderately more common in math than in
science for things which first show up in thinking to become objects of
study; this adds to the weirdness of drawing a line between object and
meta in math. Here’s one stack of examples: one can get from the
activities of [counting, ordering, measuring (lengths, areas, volumes,
times, masses), comparing in quantity/size, adding, taking away,
distributing (which one does initially with particular things)] to
numbers (as abstract things which can be manipulated) and arithmetic on
numbers (like, one can now add 2 and 3, as opposed to only being able to
put together a collection of 2 objects of some kind with a collection of
3 objects of another kind), which is a main contributor to e.g. opening
up an arena of mathematical activities in elementary number theory,
algebra, and geometry; one can get from one doing
operations/calculations to/with numbers (like squaring the side length
of a square to find its area) to the notion of a function (mapping
numbers to numbers), which contributes to it becoming sensible to
e.g. add functions, rescale functions, find fourier decompositions of
periodic functions, find derivatives, integrate, find extrema, consider
and try to solve functional equations; one can again turn aspects of
these activities with functions into yet more objects of study, e.g. now
getting vector spaces of functions, fourier series/transforms (now as
things you might ask questions about, not just do), derivatives and
integrals of functions, functionals, extremal points of functions, and
differential equations, and looking at one’s activities with functions
can e.g. let/make one state and prove the fundamental theorem of
calculus and the extreme value theorem; etc.. (I think these examples
aren’t entirely historically accurate — for example, geometric thinking
and infinitesimals are neglected in the above story about how calculus
was developed — but I think the actual stories would illustrate this
point roughly equally well. Also, the actual process is of course not
that discrete: there aren’t really clear steps of getting objects from
activities and starting to perform new activities with these new
objects.) (To avoid a potential misunderstanding: even though many
things studied in mathematics are first invented/discovered/encountered
“in” our (thinking-)activities, I do not mean to say that the
mathematical study of these things is then well-seen as the study of
some aspects of (thinking-)activities — it’s probably better-seen as a
study of some concrete abstract things (even though it is often still
very useful to continue to understand these abstract things in part by
being able to perform and understand something like the activities in
which they first showed up).) Philosophy also does a bunch of seeing
things in thought and proceeding to talk about them; here’s an example
stack: “you should do X”-activities -&gt; the notion of an obligation
-&gt; developing systems of obligations, discussing when someone has an
obligation -&gt; the notion of an ethical system/theory -&gt; comparing
ethical theories, discussing how to handle uncertainty over ethical
theories -&gt; the notion of a moral parliament. Of course, science also
involves a bunch of taking some stuff discovered in previous activities
as subject matter — consider how there is a branch of physics concerned
with lenses and mirrors and a branch concerned with electric circuits
(with batteries, resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) or how it’s
common for a science to be concerned with its methodology (e.g.,
econometrics isn’t just about running regressions on new datasets or
whatever, but also centrally about developing better <a
href="https://www.dsecoaching.com/pdf/2008%20Angrist%20Pischke%20MostlyHarmlessEconometrics.pdf">econometric
methods</a>) — but I guess that given that this step tends to take one
from some very concrete stuff in the world to some somewhat more
abstract stuff, there’s a tendency for these kinds of steps to exit
science and land in math or philosophy (depending on whether the
questions/objects are clearly specified or not) (for example, if an
econometrician asks a clear methodological question that can be
adequately studied without needing to make reference to some real-world
context, then that question might be most appropriately studied by a
[mathematical statistic]ian).)<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I should maybe say more here, especially if I actually
additionally want to communicate some direct intuition that the two
things are equi-infinite.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn5"><p>incidentally, if you squint, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem">Gödel’s
completeness theorem</a> says that anything which can be talked about
coherently exists; it’d be cool to go from this to saying that in math,
given any “coherent external structure”, there is an “internal
structure”/thing which [gives rise to]/has that external structure;
unfortunately, in general, there might only be such a thing in the same
sense that there is a “proof” of the Gödel sentence <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> — (assuming PA is consistent) there is
indeed an object <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in some model of
PA such that the sentence we thought meant that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a proof of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> evaluates to True, but unfortunately
for our story (and fortunately for the coherence of mathematics), this
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> does not really correspond to a
proof of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.<a href="#fnref5"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>One could try to form finer complexity classes (maybe
like how there are different infinite cardinalities in set theory),
i.e., make it possible to consider one infinite problem more infinite
than another. I’d guess that the problems considered here would still
remain equi-infinite even if one attempts some reasonable such
stratification).<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
